      <div class="headline">Officers: Update your profile</div>
    You're more than what's on your SURF. Your first step is to input your work experience, skills, and other relevant information in MyVector. We've provided a guide for you here. This information will be seen by billet owners as they search for officers that are most suitable for their positions. Tip: The more information you provide, the better the billet owners will be able to make an assessment on choosing specific officers. Please provide this information by 31 January 2017 so that gaining commanders have enough time to search.

    The Find a Billet tool lets you quickly filter down to billets you'd like to fill. Thanks to the participation by billet owners, you'll see a lot more data then you would in AMS. Feel free to reach out to billet POCs who have made their contact information public!
